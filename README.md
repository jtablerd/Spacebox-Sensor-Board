# Spacebox-Sensor-Board
Sensor Board for Spacebox

This code runs on an Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266, and sends Temperature, Humidity, and Lux values to ThingSpeak.io, and to a webserver
on port 80 for debugging.

I am NOT great at this and totally aware that the code is hacked to pieces and is NOT pretty....BUT it works!
